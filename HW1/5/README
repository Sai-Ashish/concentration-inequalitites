As we can see from the plot that,
Best possible bound for the tail probability is found by directly minimizing the mgf over lambda from chernoff bound

Now among bennett's and hoeffdings inequality......


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
COMPARISION BETWEEN HOEFFDINGS AND BENNETTS INEQUALITY
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
LOW VARIANCE

Bennetts inequality is the best tighter bound for low variance since it upper bounds the mgf by taking into account the variance too...
Then comes Hoeffdings inequality as is just an upper bound on the mgf's by using hoeffdings lemma


Thus Bennett's inequality is a tighter bound when Random Variable has low variance.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
HIGH VARIANCE

Now, We analyse the bennett's bound for high variance which is p=0.5 ie variance is maximum for p=0.5 for bernoulli rv 

From the plot we can see that hoeffdings inequality is marginally better bound than bennetts ..(both the bounds are close to each other
with hoeffdings marginally better)
